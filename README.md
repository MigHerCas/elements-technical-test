# Elements Candidate Assignment - Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 

# Pre-requisites üìã
This project has been built with: 

- `yarn [1.22.4]`
- `node [12.19.0]`
- `Typescript [^4.1.3]`
- `React [17.0.1]`
- `Next [10.0.5]`

# Installation üõ†Ô∏è
First, project dependencies installation:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

As .env variables are used within this project, you need to set them up.

```bash
cp .env.sample .env.local
```

Next.js has its own environment variables system, so you need to copy those variables within `next.config.js`

```js
// next.js.config
...
env: {
    {VariableName}: {value},
  },
}
...
```

This being done, there are only two remaing steps to have our application running üöÄ: 

Tab 1 in our terminal: 

Init a [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) instance.

```bash
npm run server
# or
yarn run server
```
Tab 2:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```

You should now see something like this: 
```bash
yarn run v1.22.4
$ next dev

Loaded env from {yourPath}/elements-technical-test/.env.local
ready - started server on http://localhost:3000
event - compiled successfully
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Design üé®

As I always try to bring my own value or touch to every project I work on, I decided to create my own Elements themed design. 

_‚ö†Ô∏è Please note ‚ö†Ô∏è:_

_As this is not a real-life project, the design has established a serie of guidelines such as layout, colors and elements. During development phase, a few things have changed, so take it as a `sandbox` where I've projected my ideas as long as they were popping up in my head._

### User stories üë§
Completed / uncompleted user stories or requirements:  

- [x] 1. As a Reviewer, I want a web application that can show the weather data that is supplied by my server.
- [x] 2. As a User, I want to see a home screen with all the cities that are available on the API.
- [x] 3. As a User, I want the cities to be sorted alphabetically.
- [x] 4. As a User, I want to be able to refresh the data that is on the home screen.
- [x] 5. As a User, I want to be able to click on a city and see the weather results on a separate detail screen. The detail screen should be reachable
by a direct URL.
- [x] 6. As a User, I want all the temperatures to be displayed in Celsius.
- [x] 7. As a User, I want the temperatures to be displayed in chronological order.
- [ ] 8. As a User, I want to have the ability to hide/unhide a city and remember my choice after a page reload.

### Features
- [ ] Unit testing: after trying many set-ups using: [Jest - Typescript - Nextjs - ESLint], I didn't make it.

- [ ] Error handling (API error | connection issue). 
Due to a lack of time, I haven't gone through this user story. Feel free to check this project that covers this functionality: [spotify-react-app](https://github.com/MigHerCas/spotify-react-app)

### Personal comment
As this assessment allows to use as much time as desired, I tried to build something really cool since that's why I try to do with every assessment that I've completed. In my opinion, I owe this to myself if I always deffend my creativeness during the interviews.

## Things I am more proud of

- Use of utils as the core of the project: this folder contains the most complex part of the project. 
- Use of Map and Set JS objects. 
- Clip-path on background image. 
- More structured design
- Nice theme switcher
- Redux-way app state management
